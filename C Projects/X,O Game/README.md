# x,o game

This is a C program that implements the classic x,o game for two players. 

Players take turns marking the 3x3 grid with either 'X' or 'O'. The first player to complete a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of their symbol wins. If the grid fills up without a winner, it's a draw.


## Features:

* User-friendly interface with a numbered grid for easy input.
* Clear turn indication (X always starts).
* Win detection for both horizontal, vertical, and diagonal   rows.
*   Tie detection in case the grid fills up without a winner.
    Option to play again after a win or draw.
